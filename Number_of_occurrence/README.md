<h2>Number of Occurrence</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that counts the number of occurrences of a specific element in an array. The code takes an input array of elements and a target element, counts how many times the target element appears in the array, and returns the count. This can be useful in various data analysis and programming tasks where you need to determine the frequency of a particular value within a dataset.<br>

## Introduction

Counting the number of occurrences of an element within an array is a common operation in data analysis and programming. This Python code provides a straightforward and efficient way to perform this task. Whether you are analyzing data, searching for specific elements, or verifying data integrity, the ability to count occurrences is a valuable tool.

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. First sort the array of numbers.<br>
2. Find the index of number whose occurence is to be counted using binary search.<br>
3. After finding the index of nunmber check its post and prior if that number exists.<br>
    * Repeat this process unitil the number to be counted is same.
4. Return 0 if the target element is not found else return the count of the occurence.<br>
