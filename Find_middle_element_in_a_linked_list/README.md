<h2>Find middle element in a Linked List</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code for finding the middle element of a singly linked list. The code efficiently determines the middle element, making it suitable for large linked lists without the need to traverse the list multiple times.<br>

## Introduction

Finding the middle element of a linked list is a common problem in computer science and is used in various algorithms and data structures. The middle element is crucial in scenarios like binary search algorithms and splitting a linked list into two halves for various purposes.<br>

## Algorithum
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Count the number nodes in the linked list by traversing the whole list once.<br>
2. After getting the number of nodes we can calculate the possition of the middle node<br>
3. Traverse till the possition of the middile and return it.<br>
