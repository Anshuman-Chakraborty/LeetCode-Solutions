<h2>Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code for a simple program that sorts an array containing only the values 0, 1, and 2. This sorting algorithm is often referred to as the "Dutch National Flag Problem" and is used to arrange the elements of the array in ascending order.

## Introduction

The "Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s" code provides a solution to a common programming problem where you need to sort an array of values that can only be 0, 1, or 2. This problem is a variation of the Dutch National Flag Problem and is often used to demonstrate the efficiency of different sorting algorithms.

## Dutch National Flag Algorithum

Dutch Flag Algorithm (DFA) is one of the most basic and important algorithms for arrays. It is used to segregate an array consisting of 3 numbers in linear time complexity. The worst time complexity for DFA is O(n) and the space complexity for the algorithm is O(1).

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Traverse the given array and count the number of zero, one and two's in the array.<br>
2. While the count of zero is greater than one declare the array elements zero continuing to one and two in a similar manner.<br>
3. Return sorted array done by Dutch National Flag Algorithm.<br>
