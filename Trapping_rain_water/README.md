<h2>Trapping Rain Water</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code for solving the "Trapping Rain Water" problem. This classic problem involves finding the maximum amount of rainwater that can be trapped between bars or walls given an elevation map.

## Introduction

The "Trapping Rain Water" problem is a well-known algorithmic challenge where you are given an array representing the elevation of walls or bars, and you need to calculate the maximum amount of rainwater that can be trapped between these walls. It simulates the idea of trapping rainwater in the cavities between the bars, and the goal is to find the total trapped water.<br>

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Initialize two pointers, left and right, at the beginning and end of the elevation map, respectively.<br>

2. Initialize two variables, max_left and max_right, to keep track of the maximum elevation encountered on the left and right sides, initially set to 0.<br>

3. Initialize a variable water to store the total trapped water, initially set to 0.<br>

4. While the left pointer is less than the right pointer:<br>

* Calculate the minimum of max_left and max_right.<br>
* If the current elevation at left is less than the minimum, add the difference between the minimum and the elevation at left to water, and update max_left.<br>
* If the current elevation at right is less than the minimum, add the difference between the minimum and the elevation at right to water, and update max_right.<br>
* Move the pointers towards each other.<br>
5. Continue this process until the left pointer is equal to or greater than the right pointer.<br>

6. Return the water variable, which contains the maximum trapped rainwater.<br>
