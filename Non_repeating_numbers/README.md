<h2>Non Repeating Numbers</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that identifies non-repeating numbers within an array of integers. Non-repeating numbers, also known as unique numbers, are elements that appear only once in the given array. This code helps you find and extract these unique elements from an array efficiently.<br>

## Introduction

In many data analysis and programming tasks, it's important to identify and work with unique or non-repeating elements in a dataset. This code provides a straightforward way to find non-repeating numbers within an array. <br>

## Algorithum
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Sort the array.<br>
2. Traverse the array and check if the number is repeating contiously.<br>
3. If the element doesn't repeat store it in another array and repeat until the array is traversed till end.<br>
4. Return the array containing non repeating numbers.<br>
