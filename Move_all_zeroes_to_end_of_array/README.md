<h2>Move All Zeroes to End of Array</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that rearranges the elements of an array such that all zeroes are moved to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements. The code takes an input array of integers, performs the rearrangement, and returns the modified array. This operation can be useful in data preprocessing and cleaning, especially when dealing with datasets containing missing or irrelevant values represented as zeroes.<br>

## Introduction

Moving all zeroes to the end of an array while preserving the order of non-zero elements is a common data manipulation task in programming and data analysis. This code provides an efficient solution to this problem. Whether you are working with numerical data, user inputs, or any dataset with zeros that need to be segregated, this code can help you reorganize the data effectively.<br>

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Create a new final array.<br>
2. Traverse the array and add all the elements to new array if they are not equal to zero and simultaniously count the number of zeroes came while traversing the array.<br>
3. Add zeroes to the new array the number of times it was present in the array.<br>
4. Retrun the newly created array which has all the zeroes at last.<br>
