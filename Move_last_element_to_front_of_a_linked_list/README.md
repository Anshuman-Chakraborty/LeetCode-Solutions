<h2>Move the Last Element to the Front of the Linked List</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that moves the last element of a singly linked list to the front of the list. The code takes an input singly linked list and rearranges its elements by moving the last element to the front. This operation can be useful in various data manipulation and programming tasks where you need to change the order of elements in a linked list.<br>

## Introduction

Moving the last element of a linked list to the front is a common operation in computer science and programming. This code provides an efficient solution to this problem. Whether you are working with data structures, preparing data for further processing, or implementing algorithms that require customized ordering, this code can help you rearrange the linked list as needed.<br>

## Algorithum

The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Traverse till the second last element of the linked list.<br>
2. Declare its next next pointer to the original head.<br>
3. Declare its new head as temperory pointer next and temperory pointer next as null.<br>
4. Now return the new head which as created in setep 2.<br>
