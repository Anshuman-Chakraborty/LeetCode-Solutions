<h2>Count the Digits That Divide a Number</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code for a simple program that counts the number of digits in a given integer that evenly divide that integer. The code takes an integer as input and returns the count of digits that can divide the input number without leaving a remainder.
<br>

## Introduction 

The "Count the Digits That Divide a Number" code is a basic utility that provides a count of digits within a given integer that can evenly divide the integer without any remainder. This can be helpful in various mathematical and programming scenarios where you need to analyze the factors of a number on a digit-by-digit basis.<br>

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Store the last digits of the number by moduling and dividing the number till the number is not equal to zero.<br>
2. Take a counting variable which counts if digit is divisible with the number.<br>
3. Retrun the count at last when all the digits are checked.<br>
