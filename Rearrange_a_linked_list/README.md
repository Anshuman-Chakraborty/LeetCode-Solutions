<h2>Rearrange a linked list</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that rearranges the elements of a singly linked list in a specific order. The code takes an input singly linked list and rearranges its elements according to a predefined pattern or order. This operation can be useful in various data manipulation and programming tasks where you need to reorganize the elements in a linked list.<br>

## Introduction 

Rearranging the elements of a linked list is a common problem in computer science and programming. This code provides an efficient solution to this problem. Whether you are working with data structures, preparing data for further processing, or implementing algorithms that require customized ordering, this code can help you reorganize the linked list as needed.<br>

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Traverse the whole linked list and store the value of the nodes in an array.<br>
2. Traverse the linked list again and declare the node with the alternative values stored in the array.<br>
3. Return the newly created linked list.<br>
