<h2>First Repeating Element</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that identifies the first repeating element in an array. The code takes an input array of elements, searches for the first element that occurs more than once, and returns that element. This can be a useful operation in various data analysis and programming tasks where you need to find and address duplicate values within a dataset.<br>

## Introduction

Detecting the first repeating element in an array is a common problem in data analysis and programming. This Python code provides a straightforward and efficient solution to this problem. Whether you are identifying data quality issues, removing duplicates, or handling specific cases in your program, finding the first repeating element can be a crucial step.<br>

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Create a hash map to store the element with its repetation.<br>
2. Traverse the array and update its repetations on hash map created.<br>
3. Traverse the array again and check the repetaion value through map.<br>
    * Retrun the element if its repetation value is greater than 1.<br>
4. Return -1 if no such elemnent found.<br>
