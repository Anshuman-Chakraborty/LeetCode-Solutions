<h2>Boolean Matrix</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that modifies a boolean matrix based on specific conditions. The code takes an input boolean matrix (a 2D array of True and False values) and performs operations to modify the matrix according to predefined rules. This operation can be useful in various data manipulation and programming tasks where you need to modify boolean matrices based on certain criteria.
<br>

## Introduction

Modifying boolean matrices is a common operation in computer science and programming. This code provides a solution to perform operations on boolean matrices efficiently. Whether you are working with binary data, implementing algorithms, or dealing with logical conditions, this code can help you manipulate boolean matrices as needed.

## Algorithm

The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Create a temperory matrix clone of the given matrix to make the changes.<br>
2. Traverse the original martix.<br>
3. If the element is equal to 1, change the row and column of temporary matrix to 1.<br>
4. At last declare the given matrix equal to the temporary martix.<br>
