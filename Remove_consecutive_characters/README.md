<h2>Remove Consecutive Characters</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that removes consecutive duplicate characters from a given string. The code takes an input string and removes any characters that occur consecutively more than once, leaving only one occurrence of each character. This can be a useful operation when you want to clean or simplify textual data by eliminating repeated characters.<br>

## Introduction 

Removing consecutive duplicate characters from a string is a common text processing task in programming and data analysis. This code provides an efficient and straightforward solution to this problem. Whether you are preparing text data for analysis, cleaning user inputs, or simplifying text for readability, this code can help you achieve your goal.<br>

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Create a new empty string.<br>
2. Traverse the string if the consecitive characters are equal the skip till they are equal and add single character to the new string.<br>
3. Return the newly created string after traversing the whole string.<br>
