<h2>Kth Smallest Element</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code to find the Kth smallest element in an array using a specific algorithm. The algorithm employed here efficiently determines the Kth smallest element, making it suitable for various applications, including data analysis, statistics, and algorithm design.
<br>

## Introduction

The "Kth Smallest Element" code focuses on finding the Kth smallest element in an array of numbers. This operation is valuable in various computational tasks, such as finding the median of a dataset or solving problems that require ranking elements by their value.
<br>

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Sort the array.<br>
2. Return kth element of the array(if 1- base indexing is used).<br>
3. Return k-1 element of the array(if 0- base indexing is used).<br>
