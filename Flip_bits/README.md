<h2>Flip Bits</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that flips (inverts) the bits of a binary number. The code takes an input binary number (a sequence of 0s and 1s) and flips the bits, changing 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s. <br>

## Introduction

Flipping the bits of a binary number is a fundamental operation in computer science and digital logic. This Python code provides a straightforward way to perform this operation on binary numbers. Whether you are working with binary data, manipulating binary flags, or implementing bitwise operations in your program, this code can be a valuable tool.
