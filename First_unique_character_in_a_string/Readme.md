<h2>First Unique Character in a String</h2>

This repository contains a program that finds the first unique character in a given string in both Java and C++. The program is designed to efficiently identify the first character that does not repeat in the input string.
<br>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<br>
The algorithm used in this program is as follows: <br><br>
1. Create an empty hash-map to store character frequencies.<br>
2. Iterate through the input string and populate the hash-map with character frequencies.<br>
3. Iterate through the input string again and check the frequency of each character in the hash-map.<br>
4. Return the first character with a frequency of 1, indicating it is the first unique character.<br>
5. If no unique character is found, return -1.
