<h2>Majority Element</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code for finding the majority element in an array. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times in an array of size n, where ⌊⌋ denotes the floor function.
<br>

## Introduction

The "Majority Element" code is a practical solution for identifying the majority element in an array. This problem is essential in various applications, such as data analysis and voting systems, where you need to determine if a particular element appears more frequently than others.
<br>

## Algorithum
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Sort the array.<br>
2. Traverse the array while counting the repetation of the element in series.<br>
3. If the count of repetation of the number is strictly greater than n/2 return the number.<br>
4. Else continue traversing the array in similar manner.<br>
5. If no such number found return -1.<br>
