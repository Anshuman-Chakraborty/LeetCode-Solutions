<h2>Find kth element of spiral matrix</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that finds the kth element of a spiral matrix. The code takes an input integer k and generates a spiral matrix of integers starting from 1 and increasing sequentially. It then returns the kth element of the spiral matrix. This operation can be useful for various applications, including grid-based algorithms and data analysis.<br>

## Introduction

Finding the kth element of a spiral matrix is a problem that involves creating a spiral pattern of integers and then determining the value at the kth position. This code provides an efficient solution to this problem. Whether you are working with grid-based data, simulations, or any scenario where spiral patterns are encountered, this code can help you extract the desired value.

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Travese the matrix in spiral form and add all the elements in new vector.<br>
2. Return the kth element of the array.<br>
