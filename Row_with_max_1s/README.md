<h2>Row with Max 1s</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that finds the row with the maximum number of 1s in a binary matrix. The code takes an input binary matrix (a two-dimensional array of 0s and 1s), analyzes its rows, and identifies the row with the most 1s. This can be a useful operation in various applications, including image processing, computer vision, and data analysis, where you need to locate rows with specific characteristics.<br>

## Introduction

Locating the row with the maximum number of 1s in a binary matrix is a common problem in computer science and data analysis. This code provides an efficient solution to this problem. Whether you are working with image data represented as binary matrices or analyzing data with a binary structure, finding the row with the most 1s can be a valuable operation.<br>

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Create a maximum counter and a temperory counter.<br>
2. Traverse each row of the matrix and count the number of 1s in it by storing it in temporary counter.<br>
3. After traversing the row compare it with maximum counter and if its count is greater store it row index.<br>
4. Repeart this step till whole matrix is not traversed.<br>
5. Retrurn the index of row which got maximun number of 1s.<br>
