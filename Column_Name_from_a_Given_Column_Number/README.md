<h2>Column Name from a Given Column Number</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that converts a given column number into its corresponding column name as used in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel. The code takes an input column number and returns the column name that represents the column in the spreadsheet. This operation can be useful in various data manipulation and spreadsheet-related tasks where you need to convert between column numbers and names<br>

## Introduction

Converting between column numbers and names is a common operation when working with spreadsheet software. This code provides a straightforward solution to convert a column number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) into its corresponding column name (e.g., A, B, C). Whether you are generating reports, automating data export, or performing data analysis, this code can help you convert column numbers to names as needed.<br>
