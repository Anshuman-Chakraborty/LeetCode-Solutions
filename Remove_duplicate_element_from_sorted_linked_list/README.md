<h2>Remove duplicate element from sorted Linked List</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that removes duplicate elements from a sorted linked list. The algorithm iterates through the linked list and removes any nodes that have duplicate values, ensuring that the resulting linked list contains only distinct values while maintaining the sorted order.<br>

## Introduction

The "Remove Duplicate Element from Sorted Linked List" code is a simple algorithm that can be used to clean up a sorted linked list by eliminating any duplicate values. This is particularly useful when dealing with data structures where duplicates are not allowed, and you want to maintain the sorted order of the elements.
<br>

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Start at the head of the linked list.<br>
2. Initialize a pointer (current) to the head node.<br>
3. Traverse the linked list one node at a time:<br>
* Compare the value of the current node with the value of the next node.<br>
* If they are equal, update the "next" pointer of the current node to skip the next node (remove the duplicate).<br>
* If they are not equal, move the current pointer to the next node.<br>
4. Repeat steps 3 until the end of the linked list is reached.<br>
