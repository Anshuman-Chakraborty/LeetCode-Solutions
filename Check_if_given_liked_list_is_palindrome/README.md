<h2>Check If Linked List Is Palindrome</h2>
<br>
This repository contains Python code for a program that checks whether a given linked list is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence of characters or numbers that reads the same forwards as it does backwards. In the context of this code, we are checking whether a linked list has a palindrome structure.

## Introduction

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. This code provides a function to determine whether a given linked list is a palindrome. In other words, it checks if the elements of the linked list form a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards.<br>

## Algorithum

The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Traverse the whole liked list and add the data  to a array<br>
2. Check the array is palindrome or not.<br>
3. If the array is palindrome the linked list will also be a palindrome else will not be a palindrome.<br>
