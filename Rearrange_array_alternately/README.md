<h2>Rearrange Array Alternately</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that rearranges the elements of an array alternately. The code takes an input array of elements and rearranges them in such a way that the resulting array contains elements from the original array arranged alternatively. This can be a useful operation in various data manipulation and programming tasks where you need to reorder elements in a specific manner.<br>

## Introduction

Rearranging an array alternately is a common problem in programming and data analysis. This code provides a simple and efficient solution to this problem. Whether you are working with data that needs to be visually structured or preparing data for further processing, rearranging elements alternately can help achieve the desired format.<br>

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Create a new empty array of same size.<br>
2. Take two variable one pointing first and another last element of the array.<br> 
3. First add the last element then first element of the array to new array, till half of the array is traversed.<br>
4. If array is of odd size then add middle element at last.<br>
5. Return the created array.<br>
