<h2>Sign of the Product of an Array</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code for a program that calculates the sign of the product of an array of integers. The sign of the product is determined as follows:
<br>
If the product is positive, the sign is '+1'.<br>
If the product is negative, the sign is '-1'.<br>
If the product is zero, the sign is '0'.<br>

## Introduction

In various mathematical and computational contexts, it can be useful to quickly determine the sign of the product of a list of integers.
<br>

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Count the number of zero and negative terms.<br>
2. If the count of zero is one or more return the sign as 0.<br>
3. If the count of negative is even return +1 and if its odd return -1.<br>
