<h2>Roman Number to Integer</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that converts a given Roman numeral into its corresponding integer value. The code takes an input Roman numeral string and returns the integer representation of the Roman number. This operation can be useful in various applications, including historical data analysis, text parsing, and educational purposes where you need to convert Roman numerals to integers.<br>

## Introduction

Converting Roman numerals to integers is a common operation in computer science and text processing. This code provides an efficient solution to convert a Roman numeral string (e.g., "XII") into its corresponding integer value (e.g., 12). Whether you are working with historical data, processing user input, or implementing algorithms that involve Roman numerals, this code can help you convert them to integers as needed.<br>

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Create a empty variable named "num".<br>
2. Traverse the string from backward and apply ROMAN representaion rules, and update the value of num.<br>
3. After traversing the whole string return the value of num.<br>
