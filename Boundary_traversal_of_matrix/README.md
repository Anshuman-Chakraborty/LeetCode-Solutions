<h2>Boundary Traversal of Matrix</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that performs the boundary traversal of a given matrix. The code takes an input matrix (a 2D array) and traverses its boundary, extracting the elements along the edges in clockwise order. This operation can be useful in various applications, including image processing, grid-based algorithms, and data analysis, where you need to extract or manipulate boundary data.

## Introduction

Boundary traversal of a matrix is a common operation in computer science and programming. This code provides an efficient solution to this problem. Whether you are working with image data represented as matrices, implementing grid-based algorithms, or analyzing data along the edges of a matrix, this code can help you extract the boundary elements in a clockwise order.<br>

## Algorithm

The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. We iterate through the matrix elements using nested loops, and for each element, we check if it is on the boundary of the matrix. <br>
2. We consider an element to be on the boundary if its row index is 0, the last row, its column index is 0, or the last column.<br>
3. If an element is on the boundary, we append it to the result array.<br>
4. Finally, we return the result array containing the elements of the matrix's boundary in clockwise order.<br>
